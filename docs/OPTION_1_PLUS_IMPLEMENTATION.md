# Option 1+ (Conservative Pyramid) Implementation Tracker

**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS  
**Preview regression coverage:** `tests/unit/sticker-preview.test.ts` verifies same-collection selection, null clearing, and invalid/missing/foreign rejection; additional regressions, not E2E conversions.
**Security regression coverage:** Additional CORS and sponsorship privacy regressions verify live preflight headers and scoped funding access; these are not E2E conversions and require no archival.
**Pack-cover regression coverage:** `tests/unit/pack-covers.test.ts` tests production fallback, per-user no-repeat rotation, allowed modes and the 1–6 same-bucket URL rule. Additional feature regressions, not E2E conversions; no archival required.
**Location regression coverage:** `tests/integration/location-autocomplete.test.tsx` covers manual place entry during key loading, SDK loading/failure, and switching from a saved venue. These are additional regressions, not E2E conversions; no archival required.
**Started:** 2025  
**Target Completion:** 6 weeks

## Overview

Converting 414 E2E tests into a Test Pyramid structure:
- **50 unit tests** - Pure logic functions
- **140 integration tests** - Component + API mocking
- **18 critical path E2E tests** - End-to-end user journeys

**Expected Results:**
- CI time: 15 min → 4-5 min (70% reduction)
- Pass rate: 88% → 97%+ (10% improvement)
- Flakiness: 12% → <2% (85% reduction)
