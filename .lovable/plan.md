## Rename "Chat More" to "Look Deeper"

Rename the AI-response button from "Chat More" to "Look Deeper" in both locations where it appears. This better communicates that the app will analyze the user's mood entry and provide a thoughtful, personalized response.

### Changes

**Two files to update:**

1. **`src/pages/EmotionJournal.tsx`** — Change the button label from "Chat More" to "Look Deeper"
2. **`src/components/daily-features/QuickMoodPicker.tsx`** — Same label change

No backend or logic changes needed — this is a text-only update.
