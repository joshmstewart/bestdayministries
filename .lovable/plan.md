## ✅ Unify Album Media Upload Experience (COMPLETED)

All steps implemented:

1. **Standardized `video_type`** — `'uploaded'` → `'upload'` across VideoSection, SectionContentDialog, SupportPageManager, AlbumDetailDialog
2. **Unified file input** — Single "Add Media" button accepts images + videos (MP4/WebM/QuickTime)
3. **Inline video upload** — Videos from file picker upload in background with progress bar overlay and auto-generated thumbnails
4. **Merged pending media grid** — Photos and videos show in one grid with type badges (Photo/Video/YouTube), captions, crop (images only), and delete
5. **Video Library button** — Renamed to "Video Library" and kept as secondary option for existing videos/YouTube
